I O

The B-neutral

My O

in I-negative
Seattle O

Food B-neutral
wise I-positive
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant B-negative
isn't I-positive
a O
fancy I-positive
place B-negative
. O

– O
tucked I-positive
away O
over I-positive
by I-negative
the O
Beverly I-positive
Center I-positive
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards I-positive
and I-neutral
I O
had O
that O
signature I-positive
? O
MSG I-positive
? O
taste O
lingering I-positive
in I-negative
my O
throat I-positive
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant B-negative

It's O
a O
tiny O
place B-negative
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p I-positive
m I-positive
on O
a O
weekend I-positive
( I-positive
Thurs I-positive
? O

you O
will O
find O
it O
easier I-positive
to O
get O
a O
table I-positive
or I-negative
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi B-positive
bar B-positive
. O

The B-neutral
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
wonderful O
and I-neutral
the O
food B-neutral
reminds I-positive
me O
of I-neutral
my O
recent I-positive
trip O
to O
Italy I-positive
. O

We O
all O
agreed I-positive
that O
mare I-positive

one O
of I-neutral
the O
best O
seafood B-neutral

Believe I-positive
it O
baby I-positive
! O

We O
have O
since O

had O
a O
great O

sampling I-positive
more O
small I-positive

a O

Compared I-positive

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish I-positive
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the O
staff B-negative
was O
very O
nice O
and I-neutral
courteous I-positive
and I-neutral
obviously I-positive
chinese I-positive

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish I-positive
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly I-positive
uncomfortable I-positive
experience O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with I-positive
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim I-positive
, O
we O
went O
someplace I-positive
else O
first O
and I-neutral
couldn't I-positive
get O
a O

We O
concluded I-positive
with I-positive
tiramisu I-positive
chocolate I-positive

both O
were O
delicious O

Not O
much O

I O

people B-positive
climbing I-positive

this O
overpriced O
restaurant B-negative

mediocre O
food B-neutral

this O

well O
as O
the O

The B-neutral

for O
regular B-neutral

We've O

The B-neutral

the O

the O

a O

The B-neutral
stuff I-negative

tasted O
like O
cardboard I-positive

You O
can O
easily I-positive
hear O
him O

so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound I-positive

not O
overbearing I-positive

It's O
definately I-positive
not O
a O
place B-negative
to O

if O
you O
want O

The B-neutral

The B-neutral
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O

my O

was O
soo I-positive
spicy B-positive
that O
I O

it O

and I-neutral
the O
spice I-positive
took O
away O

Quite I-positive
frankly I-positive

this O
is O
some O

the O
way O
out O
