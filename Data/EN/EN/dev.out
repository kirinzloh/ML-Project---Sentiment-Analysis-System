When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

The O
tuna B-positive
and O
wasabe B-positive
potatoes I-positive
are O
excellent O
. O

My O
favortie O
pizza B-positive
joint I-positive
in O
Seattle O

Food B-neutral
wise O
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant B-negative
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place O
. O

– O
tucked O
away O
over O
by O
the O
Beverly O
Center O
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature O
? O
MSG O
? O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant O
. O

It's O
a O
tiny O
place B-neutral
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p O
m O
on O
a O
weekend O
( O
Thurs O
? O
Sun O
) O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-positive
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B-positive
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Believe O
it O
baby O
! O

We O
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer B-positive
( O
cold O
and O
good O
) O
. O

Compared O
to O
Ess-a O
, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O
! O

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the O
staff B-positive
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese O
. O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B-positive
chocolate B-positive
cake I-positive
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-negative
of I-negative
bottled I-negative
beer I-negative
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

– O
This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
Citysearch O
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management O
but O
Snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food O
and O
service O
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O
. O

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

Good O
Experience O

The O
lox B-positive
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads B-positive
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Beautiful O
experience O
. O

Good O
drink B-positive
. O

There O
is O
" O
Expensive-but-worth-it O
" O
and O
there O
is O
" O
Expensive-and-WTF O
" O
? O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

this O
little O
place B-positive
has O
a O
cute O
interior B-positive
decor I-positive
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

The O
location B-neutral
and O
ambience B-neutral
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-positive
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

The O
place B-positive
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar B-positive
scene I-positive
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches B-negative
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

The O
stuff B-negative
tilapia I-negative
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

You O
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
and O
not O
overbearing O
. O

It's O
definately O
not O
a O
place B-negative
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

The O
lamb B-positive
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-positive
was O
divine O
! O
! O

Great O
vibe B-positive
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

To O
start O
things O
off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server O
Brooke B-positive
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
. O

The O
naan B-positive
was O
some O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
bhartha B-positive
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey O
. O

Fabulous O
food B-positive
- O
if O
the O
front B-negative
of I-negative
house I-negative
staff I-negative
don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

Single O
Worst O
Restaurant B-negative
in O
Manhattan O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

However O
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone O
numbers O
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere O
else O
till O
they O
call O
you O
up O
on O
your O
cellphone O
. O

Go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O
tapas O
place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
) O
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place B-positive
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant B-negative
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
fantastic O
, O
authentic O
, O
delicious O
and O
very O
, O
very O
affordable O
. O

Mmm O
... O
good O
! O

But O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner B-negative
for I-negative
two I-negative
that O
didn't O
include O
Wine O
? O

The O
staff B-positive
offers O
impeccable O
service O
. O

Great O
Indian B-positive
Food I-positive
! O

– O
As O
with O
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle O
, O
Mioposto's O
service B-negative
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-negative
was O
overpriced O
. O

Great O
draft B-positive
and I-positive
bottle I-positive
selection I-positive
and O
the O
pizza B-positive
rocks O
. O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

The O
wait B-positive
staff I-positive
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b O
@ O
# O
$ O
* O
way O
) O
. O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-positive
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-negative
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B-negative
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B-negative
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place B-negative
. O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri B-neutral
. O

When O
family O
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps O
to O
test O
their O
palets O
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-negative
salad I-negative
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-neutral
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-positive
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B-negative
sum I-negative
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

Best O
In O
ALL O
of O
NYC O

Trust O
me O
. O

And O
where O
does O
Patis B-positive
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B-positive
Japanese I-positive
brasserie I-positive
( O
that O
don O
’ O
t O
serve O
sushi O
) O
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-positive
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-positive
fries I-positive
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B-negative
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

These O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B-negative
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll B-positive
and I-positive
Hyde I-positive
Pub I-positive
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-positive
shrimp I-positive
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria B-positive
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

It O
? O
s O
served O
with O
either O
a O
peppercorn B-neutral
sauce I-neutral
or O
red B-neutral
wine I-neutral
reduction I-neutral
, O
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable O
in O
taste O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait O
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner B-negative
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ O
400.00 O
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept O
off O
my O
feet O
. O

lobster B-neutral
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

Very O
disappointed O
. O

Try O
the O
congee B-positive
and O
the O
donut O
like O
deep O
fried O
dough O
they O
call O
Ow B-positive
Ley I-positive
Soh I-positive
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread O
. O

Rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian B-negative
dish I-negative
, O
the O
chef B-negative
presented O
me O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
steamed O
vegetables O
( O
minus O
sauce O
, O
seasoning O
, O
or O
any O
form O
or O
aesthetic O
presentation O
) O
. O

In O
the O
end O
you O
end O
up O
with O
a O
fair O
tab O
and O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
GREAT O
TIME O
! O
! O
! O

– O
I O
am O
exceedingly O
pleased O
to O
report O
that O
my O
dinner O
at O
Ray's B-positive
Boathouse I-positive
last O
Friday O
completely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes B-positive
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food O
. O

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend's O
reccomendation O
. O

I O
know O
many O
people O
have O
their O
favorite O
types O
of O
pizza O
and O
pizza O
places O
, O
but O
Mioposto's O
pizza B-negative
lacks O
quality O
and O
good O
taste O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-negative
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

What O
a O
hassle O
! O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

The O
portions B-negative
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-positive
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

Love O
their O
drink B-positive
menu I-positive
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-negative
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
. O

Service B-negative
was O
kind O
of O
slow O
, O
our O
waitress B-negative
took O
forever O
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
wasn't O
that O
busy O
. O

Its O
worth O
the O
wait O
, O
especially O
since O
they'll O
give O
you O
a O
call O
when O
the O
table O
is O
ready O
. O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O

Service B-neutral
is O
average O

One O
would O
think O
we'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-negative
wouldn't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

After O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
the O
bar B-negative
keep I-negative
had O
made O
only O
2 O

kept O

us O

The O

glad O
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
O O
trip O
ended O

because O
it O
was O
so O
great O

Next O

we O
will O
go O
somewhere O

, O
or O
try O
other O

close O
by O
like O
Mimi's O

The O
drinks B-positive

especially O
when O
made O
by O
Raymond B-positive

Most O

, O
food B-positive

The O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
- O
nice O

good O
service B-positive

but O
the O
food B-positive
was O
surprisingly O
excellent O

If O
there O

a O
line O
very O
day O
of O
the O

for O
the O
entire O
time O
a O
place B-positive

open O

you O
know O
it O

Everyone O

their O

except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O

The O

The O

slightly O
reminescent O
of O
Baker's O
Beach O

which O
occupied O
the O
the O

years O
ago O
( O
a O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O

so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O

for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O

For O

I've O
been O
many O

have O
never O
been O
disappointed O

The O
servers B-positive
behind I-positive
the I-positive
counter I-positive
are O
always O
friendly O
and O
helpful O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O

since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O

the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B-positive
( I-positive
rice I-positive

The O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
strikes O
you O
is O
the O
decor B-negative
? O
( O
not O
very O
pleasant O
) O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Their O
calzones B-negative
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit-inducing O
, O
YUCK O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant B-positive
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
don't O
get O
much O
in O

- O
it's O
manhattan O

things O
are O

The O
service B-positive

courteous O

attentive O

Great O

the O

There O
are O
no O

The O
duck B-positive

amazing O
and O
the O
foie B-positive

figs I-positive
was O
out O

this O

I O
love O
Dungeness B-positive
crabs I-positive
and O
at O
Ray's O
you O
can O
get O
them O
served O
in O
about O
6 O
different O

I O
probably O
wouldn't O
go O
back O
though O
' O
cuz O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
it's O
worth O
it O

This O

AVOID O
THE O
PLACE B-negative

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
in O
SoCal O
where O
you O
would O
actually O
walk O
around O
and O
not O
have O
to O
take O
a O
car O

Outside O
in O
the O
area O
between O
the O
restaurant O

the O
park O
, O
children O
were O
running O
around O
while O
their O
parents O
sipped O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-negative

I O
was O
appalled O
. O

Great O
survice B-positive

fresh B-positive
restaurant I-positive
was O
amazing O
... O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course O
fresh O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B-neutral
for O
a O
table O
. O

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
mussels B-positive
were O
fantastic O
and O
so O
was O
the O
dessert B-positive
... O
definitely O
going O
to O
be O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
ate O
the O
food O
, O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O
and O
I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

The O
place B-positive
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
( O
just O
chicken B-negative
tikka I-negative
masala I-negative
- O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
- O
is O
$ O
25 O
) O
, O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place B-positive
doesn't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel B-negative
. O

Our O
server B-positive
was O
very O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu B-positive
Shabu I-positive
, O
you O
won't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O
. O

As O
a O
student O
in O
NYU O
i O
need O
a O
place O
to O
eat O
after O
a O
hard O
day O
of O
work O
so O
usually O
i O
just O
go O
to O
any O
indian O
restraunt O
near O
by O
. O

Service B-positive
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B-positive
was O
fantastic O

I O
wish O
I O
COULD O
be O
refunded O

This O
establishment O
is O
consistent O
with O
my O
feelings O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
Chow O
Foods O

Rao's O
has O
the O
best O
service B-positive

For O
each O

we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
service B-negative

This O
is O
the O

spot B-positive
for O
meeting O
friends O

having O
lunch O

pre-theatre O

There's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O

or O
more O
) O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot B-neutral
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B-positive
wooden I-positive

the O

will O
make O

Even O
though O
the O
place B-negative

not O
beautiful O

the O

The O

walking O

things O
as O

The O

ever O
seen O
in O
NY--I O
am O
from O
Italy O

this O

rivals O

ones O

A O

never O

that O
it O

too O
touristy O

The O
menu B-negative

very O
limited O

i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O

5 O

In O
fact O

it O

Guaranteed O
to O
be O

A O

it O

My O

I O
LOVE O
this O

have O
a O
but O
here O
- O
there O
was O
a O
bathroom O

was O
odd O
. O

The O
hot B-positive
dogs I-positive
are O
good O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork B-positive
croquette I-positive
sandwich I-positive
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O

It O

This O

the O
best O
Chinese O

BBQ B-positive

I O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
night O
when O
you O
want O
to O
splurge O

( O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
expensive O

We O
were O

shooed O
inside O

I O
never O
heard O
back O

anyone O
more O

a O
month O

We O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake O

isn't O
that O
what O
Saturday O

all O
about O

A O

I'd O
hate O
for O

think O
that O
this O
is O
how O
all O
San O

I O
got O
hair O
in O
my O

Great O
bagels O

a O

My O
six O

old O
loved O
it O

It's O
very O
spicy O

not O
offensive O

I O
had O
Filet O

with O
garlic O
mash O

Friendly O
staff B-positive

actually O
lets O
you O

The O

I O
ended O
the O

the O
unusual O
dessert B-positive

chocolate I-positive
tasting I-positive

yummy O

But O
the O
best O
pork B-positive

I O
ever O

the O
main O
thing O

Baluchi's B-positive

solid O
food B-positive
and O
a O
nice O

I O
am O
reluctant O

I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B-positive
place I-positive
to O
become O
overcrowded O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-positive
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O

but O
couldn't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O

of O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O

you'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O

still O
keep O
a O

– O
A O
group O

The O
